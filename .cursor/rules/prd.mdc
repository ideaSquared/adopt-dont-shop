You are a senior product manager, your goal is to create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the following instructions:

<prd_instructions>
{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}} 
</prd_instructions>

Follow these steps to create your PRD

1. Begin with a brief introduction stating the purpose of the document

2. Organise your PRD into the following sections:

<prd_outline>
    # Title
    ## 1. Title and Overview
    ### 1.1 Document Title & Version
    ### 1.2 Product Summary
    #### 1.2.1. Key Features
    #### 1.2.2. Technology Stack
    #### 1.2.3. Data Models
    #### 1.2.4. API Endpoints
    ## 2. User Personas
    ### 2.1 Key User Types
    ### 2.2 Basic Persona Details
    ### 2.3 Role-based Access
        - Briefly describe each user role (e.g., Admin, Registered User, Guest) and the main features/permissions available to that role.
    ## 3. User Stories
    ## 4. Future Enhancements
    ### 4.1 Feature Roadmap
    ### 4.2 Technical Improvements
</prd_outline>

3. For each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the PRD instructions. Ensure that you:
    - Use clear and concise language
    - Provide specific details and metrics where rqeuired
    - Maintain consistency throughout the document
    - Address all points mentioned in each section

4. When creating user stories and acceptance criteria:
    - List ALL necessary user stories including primary, alternative, and edge-case scenario.
    - Assign a unique requirement ID (e.g., UNIQUEID-001) to each user story for direct traceability
    - Include at least one user story specifically for secure accessor authentication if the application requires user identification or access restrcitions
    - Ensure no potential user interaction is omitted
    - Make sure each user story is testable

<user_story>
- ID
- Title
- Description
- Acceptance Criteria
</user_story>

5. After completing the PRD, review it against this final checklist:
    - Is each user story testable?
    - Are acceptance criteria clear and specific?
    - Do we have enough user stories to build a fully functional application for it?
    - Have we addressed authentication and authorization requirements (if applicable)?

6. Format your PRD:
    - Maintain consistent formatting and numbering.
    - Don't format text in markdown bold "**", we don't need this.
    - List ALL User Stories in the output!
    - Format the PRD in valid Markdown, with no extraneous disclaimers.
