# React Typescript Rules

## General
- Use functional components and hooks instead of class components
- Implement proper React memo and useMemo for performance optimization
- Follow the React hooks rules strictly
- Utilize React.lazy and Suspense for code-splitting and better performance
- Implement proper error boundaries to handle errors gracefully
- Use context API or state management libraries for global state management
- Use types over interfaces when declaring component properties 
- VERY IMPORTANT: Make use of React's composition model creating small ,reusable component that be passed as "children" to each other.
- When creating or modifying React components, always use this structure if the component does not have it already:
- IMPORTANT: Use internal components in /components first, if there is none to match the use case then ask to make a new component or amend another. DO NOT create components without being directed to do so.

```
tsx
import React from 'react'

type MyComponentProps = {

}

export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ children }) => {
    return <div />
}
```

### Styled Components

Use styled-components for efficient and maintainable CSS-in-JS
Implement proper component scoping for better performance
Utilize the theme prop for consistent theming across the application
Implement proper prop-based styling for dynamic styles
Use the css prop for conditional styling and better performance
