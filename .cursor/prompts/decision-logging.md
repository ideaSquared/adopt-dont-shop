# üö® MANDATORY DECISION LOGGING REQUIREMENTS üö®

## NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUCTION

Every significant decision MUST be documented in the decision log. This is a **MANDATORY REQUIREMENT** with **NO EXCEPTIONS**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Failing to document decisions is considered incomplete work. All significant technical decisions MUST be documented.

## When to Log Decisions (REQUIRED)

Document decisions when:

- Choosing between multiple implementation approaches
- Selecting technologies or libraries
- Creating architectural designs
- Establishing patterns or conventions
- Making security-related decisions
- Optimizing for performance
- Refactoring or restructuring code
- Implementing new features
- Fixing complex bugs with multiple possible approaches

## Decision Log Format

Use ONLY this tabular markdown format when adding to the decision log (`decision-log.md`):

```markdown
| Date       | Decision                | Context                      | Options Considered                                 | Selected Option   | Reasoning                                      | Implementation Notes                     | Future Considerations                         | References                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Brief title of decision | Brief description of context | 1. Option 1 - pros/cons<br>2. Option 2 - pros/cons | The chosen option | Key reasoning point 1<br>Key reasoning point 2 | Files affected<br>Implementation details | Potential future impacts<br>Things to revisit | Links to documentation<br>Related issues |
```

## Decision Documentation Workflow

### 1. Before Making Changes

Before implementing any significant change:

- Identify the decision point
- Research available options
- Consider trade-offs

### 2. During Implementation

While implementing:

- Document files/components affected
- Keep notes on implementation details
- Record any unexpected challenges

### 3. After Completion

After implementing:

- Add a complete row to the decision log
- Include all columns with detailed information
- Place the entry in the appropriate section (Architectural Decisions or Trade-offs)

### 4. Self-Verification Checklist

‚úÖ Did I document the decision with today's date?  
‚úÖ Did I clearly explain the context/problem?  
‚úÖ Did I list multiple options that were considered?  
‚úÖ Did I justify why the selected option was chosen?  
‚úÖ Did I document implementation details?  
‚úÖ Did I note future considerations?  
‚úÖ Did I include references?

## Integration With Other Processes

### Edit Protocol Integration

When following the edit protocol for large files:

- Include decision logging as an explicit step in your plan
- Document decisions BEFORE making major changes
- Update the decision log AFTER completing the implementation

### Feature Development Integration

When developing new features:

- Include decision logging in your development process
- Document ALL architectural and implementation decisions
- Ensure decision log entries match the implemented solution

## Decision Significance Threshold

A decision is considered significant if ANY of the following apply:

- It affects multiple parts of the codebase
- It involves choosing between 2+ valid alternatives
- It establishes a pattern that may be followed elsewhere
- It might impact performance, security, or user experience
- It involves trade-offs between competing priorities
- It represents a deviation from existing patterns
- It will be difficult or costly to change later

## Final Reminder

**At the end of EVERY response where you've made significant decisions**, you MUST:

1. Verify that you've documented your decisions
2. Update the decision log if you haven't already
3. Explicitly state that you've documented your decisions
