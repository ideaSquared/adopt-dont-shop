# Testing Requirements

## Coverage Targets

- 80% statement coverage
- 80% function coverage
- 80% line coverage
- 75% branch coverage

## Unit Testing

- Use Jest for backend testing
- Use React Testing Library for frontend components
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies and services
- Keep tests small, focused, and independent

## Integration Testing

- Test API endpoints end-to-end
- Validate database operations and transactions
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Ensure proper error handling and status codes
- Use realistic test data

## End-to-End Testing

- Implement critical user flows with Playwright
- Test across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Validate cross-browser compatibility
- Test responsive design breakpoints
- Implement screenshot and visual comparison testing

## Test Data Management

- Use factories or fixtures for test data generation
- Clean up test data after tests complete
- Use appropriate test environments
- Mock external services when appropriate
- Create realistic but deterministic test scenarios

## Testing Best Practices

- Tests should be deterministic (no flakiness)
- Fast execution to support developer workflow
- Descriptive test names explaining behavior
- Prioritize test quality over quantity
- Include both happy path and edge case testing
