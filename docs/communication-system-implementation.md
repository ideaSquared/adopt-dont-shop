# Communication System Implementation

## Overview

Implementation of the real-time chat system for the Adopt Don't Shop client app, enabling communication between potential adopters and rescue organizations.

## Approach

### Architecture Decision
- **Frontend**: React components with Socket.IO for real-time messaging
- **Backend**: Existing Socket.IO service and chat API endpoints
- **State Management**: React Context for chat state + local component state
- **UI Framework**: Styled-components with shared design system

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Chat Infrastructure
1. **Chat Context & Services** - Global chat state management
2. **Basic Chat Components** - Message display and input components
3. **Conversation List** - List of active conversations
4. **Real-time Connection** - Socket.IO integration

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
5. **File Attachments** - Document and image sharing
6. **Message Reactions** - Emoji reactions system
7. **Typing Indicators** - Real-time typing status
8. **Read Receipts** - Message read status

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
9. **Conversation Search** - Search message history
10. **Push Notifications** - Browser notifications for new messages
11. **Multi-participant Chat** - Group conversations with rescue teams

## Technical Decisions

### Component Structure
```
components/
â”œâ”€â”€ chat/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ChatPage.tsx              # Main chat interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ConversationList.tsx      # List of conversations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ConversationItem.tsx      # Individual conversation preview
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ChatWindow.tsx            # Active chat conversation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MessageList.tsx           # Messages display area
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MessageItem.tsx           # Individual message component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MessageInput.tsx          # Message composition area
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FileUpload.tsx            # File attachment component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TypingIndicator.tsx       # Typing status display
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MessageReactions.tsx      # Emoji reactions component
```

### Routing Strategy
- `/chat` - Main chat interface with conversation list
- `/chat/:conversationId` - Specific conversation view
- Integration with existing pet and application flows

### State Management
- **ChatContext**: Global chat state (conversations, active chat, socket connection)
- **Local State**: Component-specific state (message input, file uploads, UI state)
- **Existing Contexts**: Integration with AuthContext for user data

### API Integration
- Leverage existing `chatService.ts` with Socket.IO client
- Use existing backend endpoints for message history and conversation management
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO events
